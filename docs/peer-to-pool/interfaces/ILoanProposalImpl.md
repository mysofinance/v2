*Can only be called by funding pool in conjunction with executing the loan proposal and settling amounts, i.e., sending loan amount to borrower and fees*


### claimDefaultProceeds

```solidity
function claimDefaultProceeds() external nonpayable
```

Allows lenders to claim default proceeds

*Can only be called if borrower defaulted and loan proposal was marked as defaulted; default proceeds are whatever is left in collateral token in loan proposal contract; proceeds are splitted among all lenders taking into account any conversions lenders already made during the default period.*


### claimRepayment

```solidity
function claimRepayment(uint256 repaymentIdx) external nonpayable
```

Allows lenders to claim any repayments for given repayment period

*Can only be called by entitled lenders and if they didn&#39;t make use of their conversion right*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| repaymentIdx | uint256 | the given repayment period index |

### collTokenConverted

```solidity
function collTokenConverted(uint256 repaymentIdx) external view returns (uint256)
```

Returns the amount of collateral tokens that were converted during given repayment period



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| repaymentIdx | uint256 | The respective repayment index of given period |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | The total amount of collateral tokens that were converted during given repayment period |

### dynamicData

```solidity
function dynamicData() external view returns (uint256 arrangerFee, uint256 finalLoanAmount, uint256 finalCollAmountReservedForDefault, uint256 finalCollAmountReservedForConversions, uint256 loanTermsLockedTime, uint256 currentRepaymentIdx, enum DataTypes.LoanStatus status)
```

Returns core dynamic data for given loan proposal

*Note that finalCollAmountReservedForDefault is a lower bound for the collateral amount that lenders can claim in case of a default. This means that in case all lenders converted and the borrower defaults then this amount will be distributed as default recovery value on a pro-rata basis to lenders. In the other case where no lenders converted then finalCollAmountReservedForDefault plus finalCollAmountReservedForConversions will be available as default recovery value for lenders, hence finalCollAmountReservedForDefault is a lower bound for a lender&#39;s default recovery value.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| arrangerFee | uint256 | The arranger fee, which initially is expressed in relative terms (i.e., 100% = BASE) and once the proposal gets finalized is in absolute terms (e.g., 1000 USDC) |
| finalLoanAmount | uint256 | The final loan amount, which initially is zero and gets set once the proposal gets finalized |
| finalCollAmountReservedForDefault | uint256 | The final collateral amount reserved for default case, which initially is zero and gets set once the proposal gets finalized. |
| finalCollAmountReservedForConversions | uint256 | The final collateral amount reserved for lender conversions, which initially is zero and gets set once the proposal gets finalized |
| loanTermsLockedTime | uint256 | The timestamp when loan terms got locked in, which initially is zero and gets set once the proposal gets finalized |
| currentRepaymentIdx | uint256 | The current repayment index, which gets incremented on every repay |
| status | enum DataTypes.LoanStatus | The current loan proposal status. |
